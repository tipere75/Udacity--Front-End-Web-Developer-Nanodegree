In this project, I had to start from scratch and build out a personal blog website. Along with webpage design considerations, I had to work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting and style.

2. Javascript and the DOM: <!--<a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity---Front-End-Web-Developer_Nanodegree-Program/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Charity%20ML">Landing Page</a>  -->  
In this project, I build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.
