In this project, I had to start from scratch and build out a personal blog website. Along with webpage design considerations, I had to work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting and style.

2. Javascript and the DOM: <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity--Front-End-Web-Developer-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/2-%20Landing%20Page">Landing Page</a>  
In this project, I build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

3. Web APIs and asynchronous javascript: <a href="https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity--Front-End-Web-Developer-Nanodegree-Program/tree/main/3-%20Weather%20Journal%20App">Weather Journal App</a>
In this project, I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
