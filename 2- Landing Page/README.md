# Landing Page

This project is for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program


## Overview
In this project, I build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. The page is on all screen - from iPhone SE to computer screen.


## How to view the page
The project is published on Github pages. To view the output, click on <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tipere75/Udacity--Front-End-Web-Developer-Nanodegree-Program/blob/main/2-%20Landing%20Page/index.html">this link</a>.
