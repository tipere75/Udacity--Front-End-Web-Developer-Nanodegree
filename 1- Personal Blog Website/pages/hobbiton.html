          <p>Before Perter Jackson's movies, Matamata was a city located east of Hamilton and famous for its pure blood horses.</p>
          <p>Hobbiton movie set was completely rebuild for filming of <i>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</i> and si the only remaining set left standing. Initially scouted and filmed for <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> film trilogy, the set was partially destroyed - all that remained were white façades left as a visitor attraction. In 2010 a team of builder artisans and gardeners began the rebuild, and an adjacent area was used as the main construction base, with a joinery and brickworks.</p>
          <p>Because the set is now permanent, a more detailed planting scheme has been developed. Visitors can now experience the bare trees and long shadows of winter, the intense green and lush growth of spring and the mellow fruitness of autumn, when trees groan with apples and pears, and pumpinks sit, swollen and replete, invegetable patches.</p>
